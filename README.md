During this week 21 years ago, Enron, at the time the 7th largest company in America, filed for bankruptcy in what was the largest bankruptcy in US history. The fall of Enron is considered to be one of the biggest scandals in American history because when they crashed, 10000s of people lost their jobs and billions of dollars were lost. The scandal consisted of a mixture of bad culture, aggressive sales incentives, and serious accounting manipulations.

For our project, we used the Enron Email corpus, which is the largest dataset of its kind and contains 600,000 emails between 158 former Enron employees, mostly senior executives. We worked with the text of the email bodies and unsupervised machine learning to try to replicate what investigators did to classify the documents into sentiment analysis.
